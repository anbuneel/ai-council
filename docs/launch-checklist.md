## Messaging Framework

### The Problem
Single AI answers have issues:
- Blind spots - each model has biases and knowledge gaps
- Confident hallucinations - AI sounds certain even when wrong
- No way to verify - you just have to trust it

### The Solution
"The second opinion your AI answer deserves"
- Multiple AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) respond independently
- They review each other anonymously (peer review)
- A lead model synthesizes the best answer

### Target Audiences

| Audience | Pain Point | Hook |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Researchers | Need reliable info | "Peer-reviewed AI answers" |
| Decision makers | High-stakes choices | "Get consensus, not guesswork" |
| AI skeptics | Been burned by hallucinations | "Multiple models catch errors" |
| Power users | Already use multiple AIs manually | "We automate what you're doing" |

### 10-Second Pitch
> "Quinthesis asks your question to multiple leading AI models, has them anonymously review each other's answers, then synthesizes the best response. Like peer review for AI."
